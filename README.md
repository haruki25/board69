# Random Sound Player with Key Logging
This is a Python script that plays a random sound from a list of sound files every time a key is pressed. The script uses the winsound and pynput modules to play sounds and detect key presses.

```
python board69.py

Once the script is running, every key press will trigger the playback of a random sound from the SOUNDS list. The script will also log every key press and sound played in a file named log.txt.

To stop the script, press the ESC key.

- pynput
* winsound
+ logging

You can install these modules using pip, the Python package manager:
